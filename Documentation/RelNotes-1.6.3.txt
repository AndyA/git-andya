GIT v1.6.3 Release Notes
========================

With the next major release, "git push" into a branch that is
currently checked out will be refused by default.  You can choose
what should happen upon such a push by setting the configuration
variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
push running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

  http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitFaq#non-bare
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/107758/focus=108007

for more details on the reason why this change is needed and the
transition plan.

For a similar reason, "git push $there :$killed" to delete the branch
$killed in a remote repository $there, if $killed branch is the current
branch pointed at by its HEAD, gets a large warning.  You can choose what
should happen upon such a push by setting the configuration variable
receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving repository.


Updates since v1.6.2
--------------------

(subsystems)

(performance)

(usability, bells and whistles)

* "--pretty=<style>" option to the log family of commands can now be
  spelled as "--format=<style>".  In addition, --format=%formatstring
  is a short-hand for --pretty=tformat:%formatstring.

* "--oneline" is a synonym for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev=commit".

* If you realize that you botched the patch when you are editing hunks
  with the 'edit' action in git-add -i/-p, you can abort the editor to
  tell git not to apply it.

* git-archive learned --output=<file> option.

* git-bisect shows not just the number of remaining commits whose goodness
  is unknown, but also shows the estimated number of remaining rounds.

* git-branch -r shows HEAD symref that points at a remote branch in
  interest of each tracked remote repository.

* git-config learned -e option to open an editor to edit the config file
  directly.

* git-format-patch can be told to use attachment with a new configuration,
  format.attach.

* git-imap-send learned to work around Thunderbird's inability to easily
  disable format=flowed with a new configuration, imap.preformattedHTML.

* git-rebase can be told to rebase the series even if your branch is a
  descendant of the commit you are rebasing onto with --force-rebase
  option.

* git-send-email learned --confirm option to review the Cc: list before
  sending the messages out.

(developers)

* Test scripts can be run under valgrind.


Fixes since v1.6.2
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.2.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

Here are fixes that this release has, but have not been backported to
v1.6.2.X series.

* .gitignore learned to handle backslash as a quoting mechanism for
  comment introduction character "#" (backport by merging dd482ee if
  needed).

* timestamp output in --date=relative mode used to display timestamps that
  are long time ago in the default mode; it now uses "N years M months
  ago", and "N years ago" (backport by picking 10edf37 if needed).

* git-add -i/-p now works with non-ASCII pathnames (backport by picking
  8851f48 if needed).

* "git hash-object -w" did not read from the configuration file from the
  correct .git directory (backport by merging 272459a if needed).

* git-send-email learned to correctly handle multiple Cc: addresses
  (backport by merging afe756c if needed).
